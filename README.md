this is the repository for my personal website, which is a remake of a pure html5+css site which is currently running on http://cederberg.xyz. the goal is a site with responsive design, which is viewable not only on modern computer monitors but also phones and tablets. i also intend to remake my previous personal wordpress blog with this.

the site is viewable live during development through Gatsby Cloud at:  
https://cederbergxyzmain.gtsb.io/

## Packages

Gatsby, Tailwindcss, TypeScript etc.

## Quick start

1.  **Install.**
    Navigate into the site's directory and install all needed packages.
    
    ```shell
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Start developing.**
    Run the development server.

    ```shell
    npm run develop
    ```

3.  **Open the code and start customizing.**

    Your site is now running at http://localhost:8000!

    Edit `src/pages/index.js` to see the site update in real-time.
